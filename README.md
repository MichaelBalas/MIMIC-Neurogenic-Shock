# MIMIC-Neurogenic-Shock
The repository is intended to be a hub for sharing, refining, and reusing code used for analysis of the [MIMIC critical care database](https://mimic.physionet.org) to discover endophenotypes or biological/demographic markers that may lead to poor outcome in patients experiencing neurogenic shock.
